# Delphi WtsApi
Header and wrapper for using the Windows Terminal Services API (in short WtsApi)

Currently the project consists of
- a library for accessing the WtsApi:
  * header translation for using the WtsApi dll
  * wrapper classes for using the header more easely
- a test project to demonstrate the use of the classes

# Delphi WtsApi
Wrapper and header for using the Windows Terminal Services API (in short WtsApi)

Currently the project consists of
- a library for accessing the WtsApi:
  * header translation for using the WtsApi dll
  * wrapper classes for using the header more easely
- a tst project to demonstrate the use of the classes
